MyProfile-MVC is a personal website built using .NET MVC and SQL Server, designed to showcase my skills, projects, and experience as a web developer. The website features a clean, modern design with a focus on providing an intuitive user experience. It includes sections to display my portfolio, resume, and contact details, along with interactive features to engage visitors.

With .NET MVC, I utilized the Model-View-Controller architecture to ensure a structured and scalable solution, while SQL Server is used for managing data such as user profiles, project details, and contact information. The site is responsive, ensuring it works well across various devices.

The platform highlights my back-end development skills in ASP.NET MVC while keeping the front-end clean and user-friendly, providing a seamless experience for those exploring my work and professional background.

Technologies used: .NET MVC, SQL Server, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript.
